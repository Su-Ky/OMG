Good marketing, listen to me. You pay for it by working like a dog, I don't have all the money in the world

## Introduction

Completes the work of Epicurus of Samos and Euclid's Elements
by solving the problem of unreals on the real line,
squaring the circle with a ruler, demonstrating that classical relativistic space is invariant in the n-sphere and
relativistic time is an invention human caused by continuous accumulated change

Part of the Clinamen Theory:
<ol>
<li>Necessarily everything that moves is moved by something else (the efficient cause of
motion);</li>
<li>Therefore all movement is located in a causal chain;</li>
<li>This causal chain cannot be infinite, it must have a beginning;
At the beginning of the causal chain there must be something that "moves without being
moved", a first cause, an unmoved mover.</li></ol>

Natural products always seemed like a strange way to top it all off. To define the concept of chaos, Lorenz
uses a pot and a fire that have nothing to do with the discrete property of natural numbers. Observing the
hunting flight of the Iberian imperial eagle over a rabbit, he hits it precisely on the head, knocking it down
with a strong blow. Calculating that curve is a process impossible for the best computers. The eagle follows
a continuum of entropy in which it marks three hoops to go through until it reaches the rabbit. If it changes,
rectify it immediately.
i.e. All mathematics is correct, within its limitations, as is any postulate proven by the modern scientific
method.

## Hypothesis

Descartes demonstrates the existence of our royal line through human thought itself. I recognize something unknown and with supernatural powers in the
uncertainty of 0, i.e. what is before the photon and after the anti-photon. 

I do not deny the existence of anti entropy in nature, it is just
constructed this way to find symmetry. The operations are symmetric with anti entropy.Symmetric operations follow the Nash equilibrium with interest in gravity and
divergence.The strategy for equilibrium is achieved in an undetermined number of steps but it is certain that it will remain in
equilibrium. The perfect geometric balance to avoid collapse under Newton's laws  is the double pyramid with a perfect square base or cube.

Therefore we will also see how balance depends on the amount of entropy since the information that describes the desire for more entropy is not of known origin. It would be the equivalent of winning in game theory. The equilibrium points are the different projections over time that are easiest to
describe. For this reason I have based myself on known models to complete the body.

The operations divergence and collapse are aliases, in the
collapse it is marked that the path goes backwards but it is also a divergence.

As the straight line of human thought is unique and has formed the axiomatic postulates.

Recognize the uniqueness and existence of a line of entropy in our
own reality with this application that marks human thought.

Under the hypothesis that there is a single continuous function in fractal form that depends on an application of divergences that completes the relativistic and invariant space in the n-sphere,he constructed an algebraic body from a new Natural one based on the entropy of thermodynamics and I will complete the n-sphere with its imaginaries.

Given the properties with which I describe the universe of the entropy line I am going to treat it as an algebraic topological space on the 4-sphere.

## Demonstration

Define two parameters for my universe based on Newton's laws and Einstein's Special Relativity in a relativistic space, space-time.
<lo>
  <li>The entropy of thermodynamics as the accumulated continuum of
changes produced by the action-reaction of mass,
energy or time.</li>
</lo>
I define growth based on the second law of thermodynamics.
<lo>
  <li>A collapse-divergence operation on the continuum, such that collapse goes back to the last divergence and divergence separates the entropy path into
two, i.e. creates a knot like the branches of a tree.</li>
</lo>
I define the main elements.
<lo>
  <li>The photon as described in the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle  as the value minus infinity on the entropy line</li>
  <li>The perfect square-based pyramid as described in the corollaries of Euclid's Elements as the perfect gravitational form, i.e. it never collapses by its own mass on top of a plane, like the infinite value.</li>
  <li>The operation photon divergence to perfect square base pyramid of entropy, we understand that this divergence occurs after accumulating motion.The result is the
energy of the photons and a part of the kinetic energy for the divergence.</li>
  <li>The operation alias collapse of pyramid with square base of entropy to a higher number of photons than when diverging,by the second law of
thermodynamics.Release energy from previous divergence.It does not generate it.</li>
</lo>

## Natural, Peano axioms

Due to the principle of balance, there is a series of infinite steps from photon-anti photon to the double pyramid with a perfect square base.The mixture itself of equilibrium
defines an initial state conducive to the creation of mass, kinetic energy and perfect balance of photons and anti-photons, like the famous ying yang symbol, I can by symmetry use half of the photon to the pyramid understanding that the process is equal but symmetrical in the anti-entropic part.

The process in the entropic part is a succession of steps where the photon is the first natural one, 1, and the unattainable infinity is found in the entropic infinity.With the
operation divergence on the entropy line. We have n natural, we fear that n photon divergence is still natural. It is a process that we can complete up
to the perfect square-based pyramid.In this set of changes in the entropic line I have natural induction, therefore the new Omega set, defined as the entropy line that goes from the photon to the base pyramid geometric perfect square, is a natural according to the Peano axioms.

## I verify uniqueness and existence of a topological line that crosses photon and
## pyramid with perfect square base of entropy

The method is to find a real line, i.e. in our unique and existing reality and pass the invented line from the
photon to the pyramid through the exact same place. Therefore they will be the same straight line.

The line of reality is continuous, unique and exists because Descartes demonstrates that there is a single thought and that is why it exists, as human thought
involves the aforementioned physical models, these models form a single line that passes through three
unique points. Therefore, if this line also passes through the imaginary line that goes from the photon to the
perfect pyramid, it is the same line by Euclidean.

With the Atom, Molecular and Astrophysical Model I have 3 fixed points according to the Chaos Theory, which form another line
following its attractors that goes from the photon to the atom, to the molecular, to the astrophysicist and to the double pyramid with a
perfect square base. I have 5 points that form a single line on the known line, according to Euclid's Elements.

## We check that it fills an entire algebraic field to look for isomorphism.

To fill the space we will use a technique copied from Perelman-Poincare, applied to space-time, collapse
surgery, an indispensable tool to correctly use the finished algebraic body. We will start from the pyramid
with a perfect square base and by natural induction on the previous cases and projections in the fourth
dimension, time, the space is filled by continuity.

We are going to look for symmetry about Omega, with an arbitrary 0 between what we will call anti photon
and the original photon. Using the same technique as in N and Z and following the numbering of the letters
of the Latin alphabet on the Greek alphabet we find Me, at a distance of 12. And it forms the curious OM.
Mathematics is starting to look like a fractal.

Therefore the perfect form of entropy in Mi is a cube that in the step infinite over infinity is invariant with
the 3-sphere. Therefore the unreal π exists and is incongruent, complying with Godel's incompleteness
theorem and squaring the circle with a rule.

It also fills the 4-sphere in the imaginary body, therefore 3-sphere is totally connected with n-sphere,
therefore it is invariant.

## Conclusions

There is a single continuous function in fractal form that depends on a divergence application that completes
the relativistic and invariant space in the n-sphere.

The function is studied with Chaos Theory methods, searching for fixed points, launching tensors and
describing the attractors. Combinatorial topology and the modern scientific method are the main tools once
these tensors are found to clarify unknown questions or find patterns at different scales of divergence. The
main rule, regardless of the procedure, is that three fixed points that have continuity between their tensors
and continuity throughout the function is a sign that a pattern exists or that conjecture is true, it depends on
knowledge about the application of divergence.

Since I have completed Euclid's Elements and want to publish under a pseudonym, I would like it to be the
mythical tale of the Avatar who controlled all the elements water, fluids, earth, solids, fire, energy and age of
air, continuous change. With this reference to ancient alchemy and this story, I end this construction by
